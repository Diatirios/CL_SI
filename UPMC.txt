The main bug is processed during a list reversing (reverse, value.c).
In the list, a wrong value is inserted by a previous function.
It can be interface (interpreter.c) or parse (parse.c) function.
According to my searches, it must be parse which introduces the wrong value.
On my computer, the value is 17 (0x11)
