The interpreter is in the interpreter file. A makefile is present in the directory.

Bug 1:
The main bug is processed during a list reversing (reverse, value.c).
In the list, a wrong value is inserted by a previous function.
It can be interface (interpreter.c) or parse (parse.c) function.
According to my searches, it must be parse which introduces the wrong value.
On my computer, the value is 17 (0x11)

Correction: A way to avoid this bug is to modify the reverse function. Unfortunately, the error is so strange that the only way is to add a condition into the while, forbidden the 17 value.
Now, many tests using 'define' work and the interpreter does not crash !
